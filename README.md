# FEND Project 7 Neighborhood Map
A React app that provides a map of restaurants in St. Augustine, FL, with the ability to filter restaurants by text input. The locations are displayed on the map with markers, that bounce when the particular location is chosen, either by clicking on the marker, or clicking on the restaurant from the list. When a location is chosen, an info window opens up providing the address, a link to the restaurant's website for further information, and an image from FourSquare when one is available. This app utilizes the Foursquare API to provide data for the restaurants. In order to display restaurant data on the map, I  used google-maps-react.

## TL;DR

To get started right away:

* make sure you have npm on your computer
* download or clone the [repository](https://github.com/tostonar/udacity-map-v2)
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
* access the app in your browser at `localhost:3000`

The default service worker provided by create-react app is used, and only works in production build, with `npm run build`
